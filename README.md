## Hello there, I'm Christoph ðŸ‘‹

I've been working in IT for pretty much all my life, mostly as a project manager or product owner. I was always about software development and coded as a hobby since I wondered how games are being made, but it took me way too long to put two and two together and make it my full time job. Well, here we are...


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - A rewrite of the final project I did for the bootcamp I took, but in Next.js with tRPC, Drizzle and PlanetScale
  - Creating a small utility app that helps me keep my dotfiles synced (very early stages)
  - Starting my first tiny little NeoVim plugin (for a niche need I have right now) ðŸ¤«
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Next.js
  - Vue / Nuxt
  - Go

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
  - Why a raw sawtooth wave is still the best synthesizer sound ever ðŸ˜‰
