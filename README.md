## Hello there, I'm Christoph ðŸ‘‹

I've been working in IT for pretty much all my life, mostly as a project manager or product owner. I was always about software development and coded as a hobby since I wondered how games are being made, but it took me way too long to put two and two together and make it my full time job. Well, here we are...


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - An app to track expenses without all the bells and whistles of your average "budget trackers"
  - Starting my first tiny little NeoVim plugin (for a niche need I have right now) ðŸ¤«
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Rust
  - Wails (Go)
  - Svelte / HTMX

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
  - Why a raw sawtooth wave is still the best synthesizer sound ever ðŸ˜‰
